####### CIBERSORT LUAD Data ########

#### Aim #####

Will use the online CIBERSORT tool to check for immune cell abundence using their published method.
- Going to input the whole TCGA data for LUAD
- Then will delinate by mutation

##### Method ######

First the input files were put inot the correct format as below:
The input files are from M:\Richard B\TCGA_data\Pancancer\gene_expression_quick_comparisons which have the MT aligned data.
- These files are 'rna_seq_rsem_EL_expression_detailed_specific_mt_aligned.csv' & 'rna_seq_zscore_EL_expression_detailed_specific_mt_aligned.csv'.
- Then edited to just remove the formatting and save as a .txt file (in 'Mixture' format) for CIBERSORT upload, called: 'rsem_cibersort_input.txt' and 'zscore_cibersort_input.txt'

Then were uploaded to the cibersort website (cibersort.stanford.edu) as Mixture files.

Both RSEM and zscores were run using 100 and 1000 permutations.
- Believe that RSEM should be a better measure here...

ERROR: with zscore input as lines with NA.
- Tried deleting all lines with NA but too difficult without R so not using zscores
- After this I deleted 'rna_seq_zscore....csv' and 'zscore_cibersort_input.txt' to save space.
- Excluded from further analysis.

The 1000 permutation data were then downloaded as a CSV from the CIBERSORT website and mutations aligned to the df using the 'cibersort_merge_stanford_data.R' script.
- These merged data were saved as 'cibersort_1000_permutations_output_merged.csv' in the /Output/RSEM folder
- As all Naive CD4 data were 0, these data were not included in the following analysis

Data from this file were then analysed using GraphPad Prism 8 - analysis file in the /Output/RSEM folder called 'RSEM_Cibersort_Prism_Analysis'.


####### Results ########

Interesting results (with significant changes):
- Plasma cells
- Tfh
- Tregs
- Resting NK Cells
- M1 Macrophages
- Resting DCs
- Activated DCs
- Resting Mast Cells
- Neutrophils

Then plotted the parts of a whole. With all the cellular categories is too much to look at, so combined up into the following categories, so can be compared to MCP-counter exp:
- B cells: B cells naive + B cells memory + plasma cells
- CD8 T cells: T cells CD8
- CD4 T cells: T cells CD4 memory resting + T cells CD4 memory activated + T cells follicular helper + T cells regulatory T regs + T cell gamma delta
- NK cells: NK cells resting + NK cells activated
- Monocytes: Monocytes
- Macrophages: Macrophages M0 + Macrophages M1 + Macrophages M2
- Dendritic cells: Dendritic cells resting + Dendritic cells activated
- Mast cells: Mast cells resting + Mast cells activated
- Eosinophils: Eosinophils
- Neutrophils: Neutrophils
